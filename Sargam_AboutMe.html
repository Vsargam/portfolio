  <h4> I love my school which is dublin high. I also like my class. My greatest achievments are my scratch projects, MIT app inventor app these are my 2 greatest achievements in school. These are my greatest achievments because I worked on them with my partners and coded them alone. I am not a great coder but I still have to learn a lot more becuase I am very slow at coding. Also I ask too many peaple for help. My favorate class in high school right now is math because I have the best teacher in it.</h4>
